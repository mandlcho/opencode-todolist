# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
Keep application code inside `src/`, grouping related logic by domain (for example, `src/agents/controller.py`). Place integration layers, adapters, or SDK clients under `src/services/`. Store reusable prompts or playbooks in `assets/prompts/`, and keep developer-facing notes in `docs/`. Tests belong in `tests/` mirroring the `src/` layout (e.g., `tests/agents/test_controller.py`). If you contribute helper scripts, add them to `scripts/` and ensure they are executable.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Use the `Makefile` at the project root as the single entry point for automation. Run `make install` to bootstrap dependencies (call your language-specific installer from this target). Use `make lint` to execute formatters and static analysis, and `make test` for the full automated test suite. During iterative work, `make watch` can wrap hot-reload workflows (extend it to suit your runtime). Document any new command you add by updating the help target (`make help`).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Follow language defaults: 4-space indentation for Python, 2-space for JSON/YAML. Prefer descriptive module names using `snake_case` for Python files and `UpperCamelCase` for class names. Keep functions concise, opting for `async` routines when collaborating with I/O-bound agent services. Run `make lint` before opening a review; configure it to call tools such as `ruff`, `black`, or `eslint` depending on the stack you introduce.

## Testing Guidelines
Aim for meaningful coverage on critical agent decision paths. Organize unit tests in files named `test_<module>.py` (or equivalent per language) and integration tests under `tests/integration/`. Use fixtures to isolate external APIs, and document new fixtures in `tests/README.md` if they require setup. Execute `make test` locally and ensure CI stays green before requesting review.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Write commits in the imperative mood (`Add agent dispatcher timeout`). Group unrelated changes into separate commits to simplify reviews. Every pull request should include a high-level summary, testing notes (`make test` output), and links to tracked issues. Provide screenshots or terminal captures for user-facing changes. Request review only after addressing `make lint` feedback and confirming that autogenerated files stay up to date.
